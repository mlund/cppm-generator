    "title": "A Command Line Tool for Generating Charged Patchy Particle Models (CPPMs)",
    "description": "This is a single command-line tool that generates spherical Charged Patchy Particle Models (CPPM) which mimic bio-colloidal particles, e.g. globular proteins. The tool, `cppm-generator`, generates CPPMs by placing neutral, positive, and negative particles on the surface of a sphere, and minimise the (free) energy using Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo sampling.",
