# `cppm-generator`

This is a small command-line tool to generate spherical
_charged patchy particle models_ (cppm) which mimics (bio-)colloidal
particles such as globular proteins.

These are generated by placing neutral, positive, and negative particles
on the surface of a sphere, and minimise the (free) energy using
Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo sampling.

Details and status:

- [x] Random walk on a sphere using spherical coordinates
- [x] Particle-particle interactions using a Coulomb/softcore potential
- [x] Arbitrary mixing of neutral and charged particles
- [x] Output to `.xyz` and `.pqr` files
- [x] Command line interface
- [x] Dipole moment analysis
- [ ] External electric field to induce dipole moments
- [x] Written in Rust
- [ ] Use [uon](https://crates.io/crates/uom) for dimensional analysis
- [ ] IO error handling
- [ ] Unittests

## Motivation

Besides scientific use, this project was started as a first dive
into the Rust programming language. Be warned that you may encounter a
C++ accent that will hopefully be subdued along the way.
